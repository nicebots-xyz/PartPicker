# Ping Extension

The Ping extension is a simple, yet essential part of your Botkit. It doesn't require any configuration and is **enabled** by default.

## Features

The Ping extension adds a `ping` command to your bot. When this command is invoked, the bot responds with a message indicating that it is online and operational. This can be useful for quickly checking if your bot is responsive.

## Usage

To use the Ping extension, simply type the `ping` command in any channel where the bot has permission to read and send messages. The bot should respond with a message, confirming its online status.

## Configuration

The Ping extension does not require any configuration. It is enabled by default. If you wish to disable it, you can do so by setting its `enabled` key to `false` in the `config.yml` file or through environment variables.
